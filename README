Roundy is a markup language which is inspired by LISP and produces XHTML
output. It is planned to support HTML output as well.

Features:
- no redundancy (no double definitions of tags (start and end of the tag))
- pretty printing; configurable indentation
- handles standalone tags (tags with no "content" between the start and end
  tag) correctly
- add a doctype by assigning the attribute "doctype" to the root element
  (which is usually the html tag)
- insert text by assigning a user-configurable attribute (default: "text")
